## Why?

Do you want to fix an error you have found? Do you know a way to improve this
kernel? I am open for discussion and welcome any help!

## How?

There are many ways to help me out. One way might be to open an issue on
[Github's tracker](https://github.com/mssola/list.nes/issues) and start a
discussion. For this, mind the following:

- Check that the issue has not already been reported or fixed in `main`.
- Try to be concise and precise in your description.
- If you have found a problem, provide a step by step guide on how to reproduce it.
- Provide the version you are using (git commit SHA), as well as the version of
  the toolchain and the emulator/system being used.

Another way is to simply submit a pull request. For this, also mind these:

- Write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Extra
  points if it's in the style of the [Linux
  kernel](https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html).
- You are sure that `make` continues to work.
- The pull request has *only* one subject and a clear title. You are not
  submitting a pull request with tons of different unrelated commits.
